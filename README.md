# Recursive-Path-Finding
The following program/class reads a text file to create a two-dimensional array. However, this time, the array is 20 rows by 30 columns and it is a maze. The contents of the array are characters: a '0' represents a valid path in the maze, whereas an 'x' represents a boundary of the maze.
The maze has multiple branches, and with this program, can move in all 4 directions (North, South, East and West). The goal of the program is to implement a recursive method to find a treasure marked by the character 'T' in the shortest number of steps. The program will go through every possible path to the treasure and only keep the shortest one. However, before it finds the treasure, the program must find the entrance to the maze, which can be anywhere on the outside. There must be a condition, though, that there can only be 1 entrance to the maze.
