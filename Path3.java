Javaâ„¢ Project: ICS4U
Package: pathFinding
Class: Path3
Programmer: Shaan Banday

Date Created: Monday, May 2nd, 2022.
Date Completed: Wednesday, May 4th, 2022.

Description: Similar to Path2, the following program/class reads a text file to create a two dimensional array. However, this time, the array is 20 
rows by 30 columns and it is a maze. The contents of the array are characters: a '0' represents a valid path in the maze, whereas a 'x' represents a
boundary of the maze. The maze has multiple branches, and with this program, can move in all 4 directions (North, South, East and West). The goal of 
the program is to implement a recursive method to find a treasure marked by the character 'T' in the shortest number of steps. The program will go 
through every possible path to the treasure and only keep the shortest one. However, before it finds the treasure, the program must find the entrance
to the maze, which can be anywhere on the outside. There must be a condition, though, that there can only be 1 entrance to the maze.
